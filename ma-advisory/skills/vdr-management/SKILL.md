  Virtual Data Room classification and organization. Scans unstructured file
  uploads, identifies document types (cap tables, IP licenses, vendor contracts,
  tax filings, payroll), applies standardized M&A naming conventions and folder
  hierarchies. Transforms chaotic seller document dumps into diligence-ready
  repositories on day one.
  Use when user asks to "set up a data room", "organize VDR", "data room management", or mentions virtual data room, document indexing, or VDR permissions.

# VDR Management

The genesis of any M&A transaction involves the population of a Virtual Data Room. Sellers or their investment bankers dump thousands of poorly labeled files into a centralized repository — scanned PDFs of decades-old leases, raw Excel trial balances, unformatted payroll ledgers. The administrative burden of organizing these files represents a massive loss of analytical bandwidth.

## When to Use

- A seller has uploaded unstructured documents to a VDR
- Buy-side teams need to organize incoming data room files for diligence
- Files need standardized naming conventions and folder hierarchies
- Deal teams need to transition from document discovery to analysis immediately

## The /vdr-classify Protocol

### How It Works

1. **Ingest** each file's text using NLP and OCR
2. **Recognize** the legal or financial taxonomy of each document
3. **Map** to standard M&A index structures:
   - Legal (corporate governance, contracts, IP, litigation)
   - Financial (audited statements, tax returns, trial balances, bank statements)
   - HR (employee census, benefit plans, org charts)
   - Operational (customer lists, vendor agreements, real estate)
   - Regulatory (permits, licenses, compliance records)
4. **Apply** standardized naming conventions
5. **Generate** a complete VDR index with document counts per category

### Standard M&A Folder Hierarchy

```
VDR/
├── 01 - Corporate & Governance
├── 02 - Financial Statements & Tax
├── 03 - Material Contracts
├── 04 - Intellectual Property
├── 05 - Real Estate & Assets
├── 06 - HR & Employee Benefits
├── 07 - Insurance
├── 08 - Regulatory & Compliance
├── 09 - Environmental
├── 10 - Litigation & Claims
├── 11 - Technology & IT
├── 12 - Customers & Revenue
└── 13 - Miscellaneous
```

### Output Format

```
## VDR Classification Report

**Total Files Processed**: [N]
**Auto-Classified**: [N] ([%])
**Requires Manual Review**: [N]

### Classification Summary
| Category | Files | Key Documents Identified |
|----------|-------|-------------------------|
| Corporate & Governance | [N] | Articles of incorporation, bylaws, board minutes... |
| Financial & Tax | [N] | 3-year audited financials, tax returns... |
| Material Contracts | [N] | Customer MSAs, vendor agreements... |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Flagged Items
- [Files that couldn't be classified]
- [Duplicate documents detected]
- [Missing expected documents (e.g., no audited financials found)]
```

## Operating Guidelines

- Prioritize accuracy over speed — misclassified documents create downstream diligence errors
- Flag documents that appear to be duplicates or multiple versions
- Identify missing categories — if no tax returns are found, flag immediately
- Apply consistent date formatting in file names (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Preserve original file names in a mapping table for audit trail
- Never delete or modify original files — classification is additive

## Time Savings

Saves **10+ hours per VDR drop**. Eliminates the administrative friction of organizing misfiled or poorly named seller documents, creating a diligence-ready environment instantly.
